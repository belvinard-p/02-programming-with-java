# Module 1: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming

## Overview

In this module, you'll explore advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, specifically interfaces and abstract classes in Java. You'll learn the importance of interfaces for code flexibility and how to implement them effectively, particularly in managing the challenges of multiple inheritance. Additionally, you'll understand the role of abstract classes in designing well-organized and extensible class hierarchies.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Develop methods to organize and reuse code effectively**
    - Create modular code structures
    - Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
    - Design reusable components

2. **Apply object-oriented programming concepts within the Java language**
    - Design modular and scalable code
    - Implement proper class hierarchies
    - Use polymorphism effectively

3. **Implement error handling in Java**
    - Use try-catch blocks
    - Handle exceptions appropriately
    - Create custom exceptions

4. **Implement file handling operations in Java**
    - Read from files
    - Write to files
    - Manage file resources properly

## Key Topics

- **Interfaces**: Contracts for behavior implementation
- **Abstract Classes**: Templates for related classes
- **Multiple Inheritance**: Managing through interfaces
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error management
- **File I/O**: Reading and writing data

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Java classes and objects
- Knowledge of inheritance and polymorphism
- Familiarity with basic Java syntax
